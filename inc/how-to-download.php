	<h3>Where are Facebook videos saved after being downloaded?</h3>
	<p>When you're downloading files, they are usually saved into whatever folder you have set as your default. Your browser normally sets this folder for you. In browser settings you can change and choose manually the destination folder for your downloded facebook videos.</p>
	<h3>Can I download Live Facebook videos?</h3>
	<p>Once streaming is done, you can easily save live FB videos to your device using Eissaweb Facebook video Downloader.</p>
	<h3>Does Eissaweb store downloaded videos or keep a copy of videos?</h3>
	<p>
		Eissaweb doesn't store videos. Neither do we keep copies of downloaded videos. All videos are hosted on Facebook's servers. Also, we don't keep track of the download histories of our users, thus making using Eissaweb totally anonymous.
